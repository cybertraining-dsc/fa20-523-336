Team
Currently, for this project I am planning on conducting the research and experiment by myself instead of a team. The reason I am doing this will be to reduce time introducing someone else to the data set and coding specific to the data set’s API that I have used. However, if someone else is familiar with the data and interested in the topic, I would not be opposed to collaborating with someone else on the project. Ideally, if there are people in the class that would like to work on the project with me, a small team size of 2-3 would be acceptable.

Topic
For my final project I am planning on doing something related to stock market information and how different stocks perform under different circumstances. Although I’m not sure the exact parameters yet, some ideas that I have are correlating stock changes with the weather, news within a company, change of CEOS, earning reports, etc. These types of events with a company generally always produce some sort of price change event. What I am going to be looking for in this project is to identify better the extent of the changes and why certain events have greater influence in price changes. 
Another correlation and test I plan on doing is looking at stocks in different sectors, times of the year, employee growth: price growth ratios, and more. 

Dataset
I will be gathering most of the data through FinancialModelingPrep.com. Their API can assess tons of different fundamental and technical stock data that can be used for the final I423 project. After the collection of the data via their API, I will be running my own tests and experiments with the data. Right now, there are roughly 8000 stocks on the main US exchanges (Nasdaq & NYSE) and FMP has data that has the potential to go back 30 years. 

What Needs to Be Done
To achieve a great grade for this project I will need to come up will multiple experiments and tests with the dataset that will help the researcher(s) better understand how stocks move in certain situations. Additionally, to get a good grade on this project and to provide the viewers with appropriate and readable information, I will be providing stock charts and graphs that not only show those prices, but also different correlation and visuals to help better understand the data. Also providing a detailed description of the project will be a requirement to get a grade, because some people may not fully understanding what some stock market and company terms are and I want the viewer of my research to understand it to the best of their ability.
