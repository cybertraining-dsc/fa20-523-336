For the final project I chose to do something that related to what is most interesting to me, and also something that is wildly populare in todays age. The stock market. Mathemeticians and data scientists for decades upon decades have dedicated billions of dollars to study market patterns, movements, and company predicitions. With the stock market providing so much potential for riches, it is no doubt that it has gained the attention and spending dollars of some of the most influencial and richest companies in the world. Although this project comes nowhere near to what some hedge funds and data scientists are currently doing, my idea for the project was thought of in hopes to get a slightly better understanding on the ways the prices move after a company releases their earnings reports. Earnings reports are issued by companies after each fiscal quarter (4 months), and provide some intesting insight into how the company is doing, if they have improved, and whether or not they have reached their goals. Earnings also provide great opportunities for investors as they can find companies with good or bad earnings to profit off of.
